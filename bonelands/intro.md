# **BONELANDS**

A gothic dark fantasy setting. Regional scale. Less than a continent, more than a country. Emphasis on death, undeath, sorrow, and persistence.

The Bonelands are desaturated, cold, and somewhat barren. Mundane fog is very common, supernatural fog slightly less so. Most days are overcast, but the moon can shine through the clouds. It rains once every 1-2 weeks, depending on subregion. Medieval tech level.

Magic is somewhat common, but powerful magic is extremely rare. Few mages can cast from memory, and most keep spellbooks. Most magic drains the body of stamina, but some magic, known as Anathema, saps the soul instead, either slowly transforming the mage into a husk with no sense of  or requiring them to harvest souls themself. Anathema can replicate standard magic easily, but only the laziest, most foolish, or most sinister mages would do so.

Sparse parts of the region are feudally ruled by nobles, but many villages have significant autonomy. The wilderness is vast and much of it is marred by outcasts that practice Anathema (Anathemists) and supernatural beings.
