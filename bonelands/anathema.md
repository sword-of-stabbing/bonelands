## ANATHEMA

Anathema is the dark, weird magic of the Bonelands, in contrast to *sorcery*, which is usually simpler, less costly, and less grand. Anathema centers around perversions of life and death, and feeds on souls as fuel.

It is an esoteric and occult practice. No knowledge on Anathema is found in the cities, towns, villages, or pastures. Anathemists live isolated from civilization save for raids to harvest souls.

### ANATHEMIST PRACTICE

Anathemists make lairs or retreats in secluded places such as dense forests, mountains, and caves. Often times, they simply inhabit ruins, even the former lairs of dead Anathemists, eager to harvest the spirits that accumulate over an age.

They furnish their lairs with libraries of forbidden knowledge, stores for magical relics, graveyards, and living quarters for themselves and the rare collaborator.

Most of their work is devoted to devising methods of efficiently collecting, storing, and using souls. They send "gatherers" periodically to the nearest small towns to kidnap residents, and when the residents are within the lair, they are murdered, rendering their souls bound to the lair.

### CHEATING DEATH

Anathemists either gain undeath or die in the pursuit. Becoming undead makes one a High Anathemist. Here are a few common types:

#### LICH

A Lich is barely alive, essentially unalive. The soul still inhabits the brain, but little else of the body is intact. Liches require a steady supply of souls to avoid death, and so consume the most souls of any High Anathemists.

Liches are--without exception--sinister, twisted, and broken. Their fear of mortality, addiction to Anathema, and total isolation from living souls always drives them to insanity.

Consistent Anathema makes liches extremely durable and washes away any fatigue, making them able to push sorcery to its limits, perhaps a consolation for the fact they use so many of the souls they take to stay alive.

#### REAPER

Reapers seek immortality from outside of the Bonelands, vowing to servitude to some intruding being. They collect souls for their master and perform other duties; in return, they gain otherworldly magic, not sorcery, and not Anathema. Of course, being High Anathemists, Reapers take a cut of the souls and use Anathema as a semblance of independence.

Unusually, Reapers are eager to collude with other Anathemists, often selling their cut of souls in exchange for enchanted relics and favors, or conversely performing favors in exchange for extra souls, if their master does not provide beyond the bare minimum to preserve their existence.

As their souls are no longer with their brains, but they live on, they are undead.

####  REVENANT

Through contingent Anathemic rituals and intricate funerary rites, Revenants die, decay for a while, and then bind themselves to their own corpses. After their return from death, they require no sustenance of any kind.
