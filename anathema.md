## ANATHEMA

Anathema is the dark, weird magic of the Bonelands, in contrast to **sorcery**, which is usually simpler, less costly, and less grand. Anathema centers around perversions of life and death, and feeds on souls as fuel.

It is an esoteric and occult practice. No knowledge on Anathema is found in the cities, towns, villages, or pastures. Anathemists live isolated from civilization save for raids to harvest souls.

### ANATHEMIST PRACTICE

Anathemists make lairs or retreats in secluded places such as dense forests, mountains, and caves. Often times, they simply inhabit ruins, even the former lairs of dead Anathemists, eager to harvest the spirits that accumulate over an age.

They furnish their lairs with libraries of forbidden knowledge, stores for magical relics, graveyards, and living quarters for themselves and the rare collaborator.

Most of their work is devoted to devising methods of efficiently collecting, storing, and using souls. They send "gatherers" periodically to the nearest small towns to kidnap residents, and when the residents are within the lair, they are murdered, rendering their souls bound to the lair.

### CHEATING DEATH

Most anathemists either achieve undeath or die in the pursuit. Becoming undead makes one a High Anathemist. Here are a few common types:

#### LICH

A Lich is barely alive, essentially unalive. The soul still inhabits the brain, but little else of the body is intact. Liches require a steady supply of souls to avoid death, and so consume the most souls of any High Anathemists.

Liches are--without exception--sinister, twisted, and broken. Their fear of mortality, addiction to Anathema, and total isolation from living souls always drives them to insanity.

Consistent Anathema makes liches extremely durable and washes away any fatigue, making them able to push sorcery to its limits, perhaps a consolation for the fact they use so many of the souls they take to stay alive.

#### REAPER

Reapers seek immortality from outside of the Bonelands, vowing to servitude to some intruder of deathly status. They collect souls for their master and perform other duties; in return, they gain otherworldly magic, not sorcery, and not Anathema. Of course, being High Anathemists, Reapers take a cut of the souls and use Anathema as a semblance of independence.

Unusually, Reapers are eager to collude with other Anathemists, often selling their cut of souls in exchange for enchanted relics and favors, or conversely performing favors in exchange for extra souls, if their master does not provide beyond the bare minimum to preserve their existence.

As their souls are no longer with their brains, but they live on, they are undead.

####  REVENANT

Through contingent Anathemic rituals and intricate funerary rites, Revenants die, haunt their lair while their flesh--as fleshy undead are very unfashionable in the Bonelands for their stench and look, and then bind themselves to their own corpses. After their return from death, they require no sustenance of any kind.

Revenants retain the highest amount of sanity out of most High Anathemists. Their soul remains their own, their fear of death conquered. They sometimes regret the harm they did in their pursuit of power and immortality, and swear off Anathema altogether. Revenants are usually the most reasonable, reliable, and stable High Anathemists.

As for durability, revenants are not *significantly* more durable or magically talented than the average undead. This makes revenance unattractive to more ambitious anathemists. Revenance is the most straightforward--albeit not the easiest--path to sapient undeath.

### USES

Anathema is used to do all the unnatural, perverse, and horrid things that sorcery alone cannot. Giving life to the non-living, manipulating souls, cheating death, casting curses, and other morbid acts are all Anathemic practice.

The most basic Anathema is the coercion of souls. After severing the connection between the remains and the shade through physical or magical means, the Anathemist can now bind or contain the soul by exerting their **willpower** over it. They can use the soul as fuel for many spells by releasing its power, or utilize their power over it as the spell, binding it to remains to "raise the dead," binding it to objects to give them accursed power and intellect, or binding it to people to create unholy possession.

Using the soul as fuel provides greater flexibility in perverting the normal workings of reality.
